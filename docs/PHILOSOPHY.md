# 🧠 GammonGuru Philosophy

> **Learn by doing. Improve by understanding. Master by reflecting.**

---

## 🎯 Core Vision

GammonGuru is built on a simple yet powerful principle: **the best learning happens after the game, not during it.**

Unlike traditional backgammon assistants that suggest moves in real-time, GammonGuru deliberately stays silent during play. It only speaks up afterward, transforming every mistake into a teaching moment.

---

## 🚫 What GammonGuru Is NOT

- ❌ **Not a real-time assistant** - No hints, no suggestions, no arrows during play
- ❌ **Not a cheat tool** - You play alone, with your own judgment
- ❌ **Not a replacement for practice** - It's a complement to your training
- ❌ **Not judgmental** - Every error is an opportunity, not a failure

---

## ✅ What GammonGuru IS

- ✅ **A post-game coach** - Analyzes your decisions after the match
- ✅ **A patient teacher** - Explains why a move was suboptimal
- ✅ **A progress tracker** - Monitors your improvement over time
- ✅ **A learning companion** - Adapts explanations to your level

## 🧩 The Three Pillars

### 1️⃣ **No Help During Play**

**Why?**
- Real improvement comes from making your own decisions
- You learn to trust your instincts
- You develop pattern recognition naturally
- You experience the consequences of your choices

**How?**
- Clean, distraction-free interface during games
- No equity bars, no move suggestions, no hints
- Just you, the board, and your opponent (GNUBG or human)

---

### 2️⃣ **Learning Through Errors**

**Why?**
- Errors are the most powerful learning moments
- Understanding *why* a move was wrong is more valuable than knowing the right move
- Repeated mistakes reveal patterns in your thinking

**How?**
- Every significant error triggers an AI-powered explanation
- Explanations are tailored to your skill level
- Common errors are pre-analyzed for instant feedback
- You can replay any position to see alternatives

---

### 3️⃣ **Rich Post-Game Analysis**

**Why?**
- Reflection is where learning solidifies
- Seeing your mistakes in context helps you avoid them next time
- Tracking progress motivates continued improvement

**How?**
- Interactive replay with move-by-move analysis
- Equity loss visualization (heatmap)
- AI-generated explanations for key errors
- Statistics tracking (PR, error rate, win rate)
- Personalized quiz generation based on your weaknesses

## 🎓 Pedagogical Principles

### **Bienveillance** (Kindness)
Every explanation is constructive, never judgmental. We celebrate progress, not perfection.

### **Clarté** (Clarity)
Explanations are precise, using backgammon terminology correctly, but remaining accessible.

### **Progressivité** (Progression)
Content adapts to your level:
- **Beginner**: Simple concepts, visual explanations
- **Intermediate**: Strategic principles, equity calculations
- **Advanced**: Cubeful analysis, match equity tables
- **Expert**: Deep positional theory, variance considerations

### **Répétition Espacée** (Spaced Repetition)
Errors you make repeatedly become quiz topics, reinforcing learning over time.
